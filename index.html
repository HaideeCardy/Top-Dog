                Freddie is the oldest of the pack - but only by 8 months. He has the loving nature of a lab but the pray drive of a spaniel so don't let him loose in the woods. However if you have a ball he is all yours! He is super strong and will take on Walter in a rumble. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Status: Fred Beats Walter on account of strength and power on the playing field.
                <br>
                <br>
                Weakness: Being that little bit older Fred loves a snooze.

                Olive is smart and beautiful but taps into her skills mostly on her own terms! She is lightening fast, nimble and with super stamina - she will out play Fred any day.

                Walter is all about the people. He loves nothing more than strutting his stuff around town on a meet and greet. When it comes to dog play Walter likes a bit of noise and is often vocal when charging about. He also loves a toy and will gather them up and keep them close by.

                <br>
                <br>
                Weakness: Feisty but less powerful and would ditch dog play to go hang out with the kids.
