# TopDog

The title page with toggles to reveal info about the dogs I was able to work through quite easily.

I then embarked on a journey following a tutorial to help with the game aspect.
It was really tricky but I also learnt lots about javascript and more about how the functions work etc so it was definitely a learning curve.

I enjoyed being back using HTML and CSS as that defintiely comes more naturally to me. However, I am looking forward to completeing more javascript tutorials and projects so I can become more confident in that area.

I hope you enjoy them - we needed something to cheer us up after a few weeks of covid going around the house!
